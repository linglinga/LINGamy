Variable Type vs Object Type

1. of the followings is considered boxing? 
answer: (C) boxing means putting a value into the object named myobjx.

a. double dblx = fx;
b. float fx = ix;
c. object myobjx = fx;
d. int ix = objy;

2. Which of the followings is considered unboxing? 
answer: (d) object is on the right, it is getting a value of an int type from the object.

a. string str = ix.ToString();
b. double dblx =(double) fx;
c. object myobjx = fx;
d. int ix = (int) objy;

3. Object objdblx is of type double. Assign the value of this object to a variable of type float.
float fx = objdblx;

answer:float fx = (float)(double)objdblx;


4. Object objflx is of type float. Assign the value of this object o another variable of type double.
double dx = objflx;

answer: double dx = (double)(float)objflx;


5. Convert the string strx to a double dblx:
double dblx =

answer: use .parse: double dblx = double.parse(strx)

6.Convert the integer ix to a float fx:
float fx = 

answer: use casting: float fx = (float)int ix

7. Convert the double dblx to a string strx:
string strx =

answer: string strx = double.ToString();

8. Object is the                  class of all other data types.
answer: base

9. What is an object (the definition)?
answer: 
an entity with property and definition with some functionality associated with it.
4 functions: 
equals(object)-determines whether the 2 are equal. 
GetHashCode()- get a hash value for the object. 
GetType()- get the real type of the object. 
ToString()- returns a string that representst the type.

10. How do you declare an object in C#?
answer: by giving it a name and value: object x = 1;

What is the difference between an object and a variable?
answer: variable is a type, a value that you assign.
object: can hold the value, but must have the property to hold the value and functionality.
